TheMazeOfRobotsWaze 2.0
This project is inspired and themed by the movie Kong Fu Panda.

This project is a part of a Computer Science course called Object Oriented Programming. (Assignment 4).

In this project we demonstrate a Panda(and other charactars from the film) that can move throw nodes over the roads in our graph, the Panda can collect points by eating(moving over) the fruits in the roads, it can eat a Banana or an Apple, each can have different points values.

The user can choose up to 23 different maps to play in.

And one other thing we forgot to mintion that you can make a Kml file( you can see the path that the robot made in google earth app).


This game have two playing options:

Manually - In this gaming option the user will control the Panda and decide where it will go.

Automatic - In this gaming option the Panda will move by itself.
